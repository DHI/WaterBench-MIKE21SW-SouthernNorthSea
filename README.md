# Spectral wave model of the Southern North Sea

This README provides practical and background information on the dataset. The dataset can be cited as:

> DHI. (2024). Hydrodynamic model of the Southern North Sea: MIKE21 model setup, outputs and observation data (1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14929387](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14929387)





## Intended use

This dataset is designed to support educational, research, and exploratory activities, including:

* Experimenting with coastal and ocean modeling using MIKE 21.
* Validating hydrodynamic model outputs with observational data.
* Developing methods for automatic model parameter calibration.
* Building data-driven models, including machine learning surrogates of MIKE simulation results.
