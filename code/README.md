[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) contains the list of libraries and their versions used in the notebooks (excluding jupyter).


## I think it would be good to make some sort of index here of what is what; I know the file name is helping a lot already, but maaybe just a list is enough, as in  
* explore_model_result_data.ipynb (link): Example notebook that shows how to open mike Dfs data (not spectral) such as mesh, bathy, model outputs, and inspect them.
* etc.
